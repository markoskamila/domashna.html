            The quokka (<a href="#">/kwɒkə/</a>) ( <strong>Setonix brachyurus</strong>) is a small <a href="#">macropod</a> about the size of a <a href="#">domestic cat</a> cat. It is the <a href="">only member</a> of the genus Setonix. Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as <a href="">kangaroos</a> and <a href="">wallabies</a>), the quokka is <a href="">herbivorous</a> and mainly <a href="">nocturnal</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The quokka's range is a small area of southwestern <a href="#">Australia</a>. They inhabit some smaller islands off the coast of <a href="#">Western Australia</a>, particularly <a href="#">Rottnest Island</a> just off <a href="#">Perth</a> and <a href="#">Bald Island</a> near <a href="#">Albany</a>. Isolated, scattered populations also exist in forest and coastal heath between Perth and Albany. A small colony inhabits a protected area of <a href="#">Two Peoples Bay Nature Reserve</a>, where they co-exist with the critically endangered <a href="#">Gilbert's potoroo</a>.

        <h2>Description</h2>

        <hr>
        <p>
            A quokka weighs 2.5 to 5.0 kg (5.5 to 11 lb) and is 40 to 54 cm (16 to 21 in) long with a 25-to-30 cm-long (9.8-to-12 in) tail, which is quite short for a macropod. It has a stocky build, well developed hind legs, rounded ears, and a short, broad head. Its musculoskeletal system was originally adapted for terrestrial bipedal saltation, but over its evolution, its system has been built for arboreal locomotion.
